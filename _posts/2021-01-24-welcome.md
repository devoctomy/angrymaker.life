Welcome to my new website, a place I hope to soon fill with a articles on things that I'm imagining, designing, making, bodging, just plain fucking up and sometimes a collection of all of the above.

Over the past few years I've been getting into 3D printing and creating things as way of keeping myself out of trouble... well the pub primarily, but now we are all in lockdown (January 2021) what else is there to do?  You can only masturbate so many times a day.

I now have an assortment of printers and acquired knowledge that I thought might be useful to share on a blog for others.  Utilising my 3D printing capabilities, I've also got into making things that contain electronic components, although my knowledge is still very much in its infancy there, I still hope to share my experiences and creations for anyone else that might fancy a try.

That should do for a quick "welcome", come back again soon and hopefully I'll have something worth reading... maybe not, but it's the thought that counts.

Peace out bitches.
